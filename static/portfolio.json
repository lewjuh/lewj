It had to be created in the Engaging Networks CMS, which is far from modern, so it had to be very editable from the backend UI, as well as fully capture the clients design. Greenpeace wanted it to be very accessible and mobile friendly, but also on desktop and tablet, wanted the effect of traveling up from the bottom of the ocean. The client had a design company send over a transition animation video which they wanted to try and recreate, so I was set with the task of transforming it from video to CSS/JS, which was incredible fun! Adding in some other animations for UI elements, this page came out really well.",
